            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
              <span>The purpose of the project: </span>Get familiar with coding in Processing and be able to create creative generative art using computer algorithms.<br /><span>My role: </span>All the artworks presented are created and coded by me.<br /><span>Final product: </span>Four different artworks created with the code by the end of Programming Bootcamp. The final project is representation of human emotions in an artwork.
            </p>
            <h1>process</h1>
            <p>During the Programming Bootcamp of our program that lasted one week we had to finalize fours artworks and each consequent work had to show more complexity. At the end I created final artwork that had to combine everything we learned during programming bootcamp. At the end of the programming bootcamp from the whole course ten students were chosen to show their final work on expo and my work was one of them.</p>
            <h2>Pyramid</h2>
            <p>The very first work I made during the programming bootcamp is the pyramid that changes its shape and colour every time the program is run. Due to randomized values for RGB and coordinates of the top of pyramid every time there is different result in how the artwork looks like.</p>
            <div class="processing_example">
                <img src="pyramid1.jpg"/>
                <img src="pyramid2.jpg"/>
                <img src="pyramid3.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <h2>Pong game</h2>
            <p>Already the second day of the bootcamp we started the working on the next work that had to be a simple game. I created a well-known pong game with some simple styling. Every time when a ball hits the walls or a bar on the bottom of the creen, the elements of the game change their colour.</p>
            <div class="processing_example">
                <!-- <img src="pong1.jpg"/>
                <img src="pong2.jpg"/>
                <img src="pong3.jpg"/> -->
                <video loop autoplay muted controls>
                    <source src="pong game.mp4" type=video/mp4>
                </video>
            </div>
            <h2>Patterns</h2>
            <p>The third work's idea was to create the artwork that includes patterns. I created the rectangle made out of patterned triangles and depending on the action of a user the rectangle responded with different effects. By default the rectangle blinks fast with different colours that creates psychodelic effect, but from actions it can start blinking slow, stop blinking and keep randomized colors or colour the whole rectangle in grey colours. I called this work "Psychodelic rectangle".</p>
            <div class="processing_example">
            <img src="rect1.jpg"/>
            <img src="rect2.jpg"/>
            <img src="rect3.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <h2>Final project - human emotions</h2>
            <p>For the final project that I presented on the expo at the end of the programming bootcamp I created the work that I named "Human emotions". Using everything we learned during the week I created representation of human emotions like sadness, anger, love and happiness with moving shapes. After the expo we had unofficial voting and my work got the second place. People liked it because of creative and untrivial approach of mine to this project.</p>
