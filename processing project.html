        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          <span>The purpose of the project: </span>Get familiar with coding in
          Processing and be able to create creative generative art using
          computer algorithms.<br /><span>My role: </span>All the artworks
          presented are created and coded by me.<br /><span
            >Final product: </span
          >Four different artworks created with the code by the end of
          Programming Bootcamp. The final project is representation of human
          emotions in an artwork.

        <h1>process</h1>
        <p>
          During the Programming Bootcamp of our program that lasted one week we
          had to finalize fours artworks and each consequent work had to show
          more complexity. At the end I created final artwork that had to
          combine everything we learned during programming bootcamp. At the end
          of the programming bootcamp from the whole course ten students were
          chosen to show their final work on expo and my work was one of them.
        </p>
        <h2>Pyramid</h2>
        <p>
          The very first work I made during the programming bootcamp is the
          pyramid that changes its shape and colour every time the program is
          run. Due to randomized values for RGB and coordinates of the top of
          pyramid every time there is different result in how the artwork looks
          like.
        </p>

          <img src="images/pyramid1.jpg" alt="first project example" />
          <img src="images/pyramid2.jpg" alt="first project example" />
          <img src="images/pyramid3.jpg" alt="first project example" />
        </div>
        <h2>Pong game</h2>
        <p>
          Already the second day of the bootcamp we started working on the next
          work that had to be a simple game. I created a well-known pong game
          with some simple styling. Every time when a ball hits the walls or a
          bar on the bottom of the screen, the elements of the game change their
          colour.
        </p>

            game example">
          </video>
        </div>
        <h2>Patterns</h2>
        <p>
          The third work's idea was to create the artwork that includes
          patterns. I created the rectangle made out of patterned triangles and
          depending on the action of a user the rectangle responded with
          different effects. By default the rectangle blinks fast with different
          colours that creates psychodelic effect, but from actions it can start
          blinking slow, stop blinking and keep randomized colors or colour the
          whole rectangle in grey colours. I called this work "Psychodelic
          rectangle".

        </div>
        <h2>Final project - human emotions</h2>
        <p>
          For the final project that I presented on the expo at the end of the
          programming bootcamp I created the work that I named "Human emotions".
          Using everything we learned during the week I created representation
          of human emotions like sadness, anger, love and happiness with moving
          shapes. After the expo we had unofficial voting and my work got the
          second place. People liked it because of creative and untrivial
          approach of mine to this project.
