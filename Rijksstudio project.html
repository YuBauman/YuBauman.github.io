        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>
          For this project we worked in a group of 5 people. Since we all had to
          conduct website testing and interviews with the participants, the
          first step was to create the set-up and the protocol. First, we
          examined the website ourselves and shared our opinion, which usability
          issues we noticed. We came to the conclusion that Rijksstudio is
          supposed to work as art community and social platform, so we wanted to
          test how well it works. We also wanted to test how users experience
          the flow of the website anf its UI elements. Based on this we
          established research questions that covered the usability aspects we
          were interested in.<br />
          We established the tasks the participant have to execute during
          testing, the set-up and tools. It was very important that we all
          follow the protocol so the results wouldn’t depend on our
          discrepancies. We also had the list of questions for the interview
          that we all had to ask our participants after the testing.
        </p>
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
          The testing with participants was conducted individually by all the
          project group members. It was our responsibility to find testers and
          conduct professional user testing. During the testing participants had
          to complete six life-like tasks like create the account or find a
          specific piece of art to add it to their collection.<br />I had the
          testing with an art-lover who enjoys visiting museums in different
          countries. The testing took place in Teams and was recorded. During
          the testing I observed user’s actions, emotions and comments and added
          the notes in the protocol. After the testing I conducted an interview
          with the participant where I asked him a list of questions prepared in
          advance, but also follow-up questions in order to understand the
          reasoning and his impression better.
        </p>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          After all of us conducted the testing it was the time to process
          gathered data in order to come up with the conclusions. For this we
          used different techniques of data visualisation that were used per
          task and research question. We used data cards and clusters, colour
          codes for efficient/inefficient actions of users, the chain of
          participants actions to examine the flow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Data visualisation allowed us to go through all the results we had
          from several tests and reveal the patterns, similarities and come to
          conclusions based on it.<br />As a result, we had the table of
          usability problems, visualisation of smoothness and interruptions of
          the flow, the list of UI elements that confuse users and finally the
          general opinion and impressions of the website’s purpose and
          functions.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusions and Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of the project we worked on the recommendations based on
          our conclusions. We pointed out which UI elements are confusing for
          users and has to be changed since it interrupts the flow. We also
          mentioned the functions users might miss at the website as clickable
          logo to navigate to the homepage. It was also recommended to follow
          users’ mental models and make use of them in order to avoid
          confusion.<br />We came up with the recommendation to make the account
          creating process more interesting since users found it boring and
          concluded that the website about the art could make it more
          creative.<br />After all, since we tested how well the website fits
          the role of social platform, we came up with several recommendations
          how to make it work as social platform and create an art community,
          since at the moment the website didn’t quite fit this role.
        </p>
        <h1>My role</h1>
        <p>
          During the project I actively participated in all the activities and
          discussions. I helped to come up with ideas for research questions and
          testing tasks. I was responsible for making the testing protocol from
          scratch, that included the rules of testing, introduction, the tables
          with tasks and notes, interview set-up.<br />I individually conducted
          the testing and the interview with my participant and processed all
          the gathered data. After testing I actively participated in review of
          the results and discussions about the conclusions and recommendation,
          after what I was responsible for writing the recommendation part of
          our research journal.<br />The grading of the project was divided into
          group and individual effort. For individual part I received the
          highest possible grade and particular complements about my
          interviewing skills. I found this project very interesting and
          productive to work on essential skills of the UX designer as research
          skills, interviewing skills and ability to process gathered data and
          come up with valuable recommendations and solutions.
