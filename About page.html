        <span>Hi!</span> I'm Yulia Bauman, a Russian girl from Estonia who
        currently studies UX Design in the Hague. Have a closer look, I want
        to tell you a bit about myself.

          <span>It's me:</span> upcoming UX designer, world observer, curious
          learner, caring friend, sports lover.<br />
          I am a former International Business student who was always curious
          about design and IT industry. When I was 15 I moved to Moscow
          looking for new opportunities and challenges. I got there my first
          bachelor degree in business and worked there for couple of years
          before I decided to move forward. Eventually, I got interested in
          UX/UI design and this is how I ended up getting the second bachelor
          degree in The Hague University of Applied Sciences.

      <div class="about_description">
        <p>
          <span>Why UX design?</span> I always wanted to make an impact for
          people and society, make our life more convenient and full of
          aesthetics. I believe that design is also important for businesses
          even though some might underestimate its power. Nowadays online
          presence is an integral part of companies' image and customers
          loyalty starts from their experience with online platforms. When I
          use different digital platforms, I always have in my mind thoughts
          what could be done differently and how the product could be
          improved. I care and think about user experience and that is why I
          want to be a person who makes it better and evoke emotions with my
          design.

          <span>What inspires me.</span> To be honest, I believe it is just
          everything I see and feel every day. I get inspiration from
          architecture, interiors, people, music. I believe if you look around
          and acknowledge what is around you, you will never run out of
          inspiration. I especially like simplistic and consistent design,
          that is why I am in love with scandinavian style. It represents
          everything I believe in - simplicity, consistency and efficiency. Of
          course, other people are also a big part of my inspiration and that
          is why I am always curious about other designers' and artists' works
          and lifestyle.

          <span>But really, WHO am I?</span> I am an ambiverted person who
          loves spending time and having fun with other people, but I need
          time by myself to recharge my social battery. I love reading books
          and learning something new every day. I'm also very much into sports
          and throughout my life tried more than 15 different sports. Now
          snowboarding, pole dancing, stretching and other active sports are
          big part of my life.

          Here is something I would like you to know about my
          <span>personality</span> and my <span>values</span>. I'm a
          hard-working person with some signs of a perfectionist. I'm caring
          and I believe that kindness will save the world. If you asked my
          friends to describe me they would say that I am a funny and positive
          person who always looks for a reason to smile. I'm easy-going but
          get totally serious when it is needed. I want to make an impact and
          leave something valuable in this world.

          <span>What I am up for now.</span> Currently I am learning and
          practicing design aspects every day (even in my spare time because I
          just cannot stop thinking about it). I surrounded myself with
          inspiration, books, movies, people and everything else that is
          related to design. For now I am looking for opportunities to move
          more from theory to practice, that's why I try to find interesting
          projects in which I could contribute. Even though I'm in the
          beginning of my path as a designer, I'm seeking for improvement and
          growing in UX/UI design and work on it every day with great passion.
