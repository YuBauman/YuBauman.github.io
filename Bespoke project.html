        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          <span>The purpose of the project: </span>Create a valuable digital
          gifting experience for a user who receives intangible gift from loved
          ones on distance due to studies abroad.<br /><span>My role: </span>The
          project was realised in a design team of two people so I participated
          in all levels of projects and design thinking process.<br /><span
            >Final product: </span
          >Digital and physical prototypes thar represent valuable gifting
          experience for persona
        </p>
        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>
          The project consisted of two major parts, where the first part
          consisted of <span>emphathize</span> and <span>define</span> modes,
          while the second part was <span>ideate, prototype and test</span>.
        </p>
        <h2>Emphathize</h2>
        <p>
          As a design team, first we established research methods and research
          questions that were suitable for our purpose.
        </p>
        <h3>Research methods:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Informal interview</li>
          <li>Ethnographic interview</li>
          <li>Observation</li>
          <li>Exploration of artifacts</li>
          <li>Desk research</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Research questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            What helps the user to feel close with family and friends back home?
          </li>
          <li>What are experiences that the user had with intangible gifts</li>
          <li>
            What are the factors that make the gifting experience memorable for
            the user
          </li>
          <li>
            Which digital platforms/applications play an important role in their
            life
          </li>
          <li>
            What are core values for the user when preparing a gift for friends
            and family during holidays/celebration
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As the set-up was ready, each member of the design team member
          gathered data on the assigned user according to the methods and
          research questions. First I had informal interview with my user to
          create relaxed atmosphere and get used to each other before we get
          down to business. For the second formal interview I prepared questions
          about user's personality, his surrounding, his values and his
          preferences and experiences with gifting. For observation I visited
          user's house and observed him during ineterviews. As a part of
          observation I also prepared a gift for a user for Dutch holiday
          Sinterklaas, so I could see the user in the gift receiving environment
          and how he behaves.
        </p>
        <h2>Define</h2>
        <p>
          After data gathering it was time to establish user insights and his
          needs. As a design team, we combined our findings and made persona and
          design vision based on it.
        </p>
        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <img src="images/persona.png" />
        <h3>Design vision</h3>
        <h4>Design statement gifting experience</h4>
        <p>
          The experience we want our user to have is to feel competent through
          overcoming a challenge, be engaged by the playfulness and humorous
          nature of the gift, and feel connected and supported by his friends.
        </p>
        <h4>UX factors</h4>
        <p>
          <span>Activation and Immersion, </span>since our user likes playing
          video games, he needs to be engaged through activation and elements of
          surprise, experience should be playful and fun. The user also likes to
          be challenged in order to get rewards. Our user likes to learn new
          skills and explore.<br />
          <span>Relatedness, </span>because our user is very close with his
          friends, and now, when he is studying in The Hague, far from his home,
          he misses having fun together with his friends. He needs to feel that
          they don't forget him and that they are as close as they have always
          been.<br />
          <span>Competence, </span>because our user works on his skills in order
          to feel better about himself. Achieving goals and learning new skills
          makes his self-confidence grow.
        </p>
        <h2>Ideate</h2>
        <p>
          For ideate part different creative techniques were used in order to
          come up with different untrivial ideas. First, I participated in
          brainstorm sessions with my partner. We used creative technique of
          forced connections to diverge ideas. For diverging part I came up with
          30+ different ideas how to cover user's needs according to UX factors.
          Each idea was sketched. After diverging I switched to converging to
          choose the best ideas or creating new ones combining several sketches.
          To improve ideas we used storyboards and dramatic arc for our
          concepts.
        </p>
        <img src="images/dramatic arc.png" />
        <p>
          At the end, my partner and I combined our design concepts and settled
          the final design team concept for prototyping.
        </p>
        <h3>Design team concept</h3>
        <h4>Token</h4>
        <p>
          A mysterious book with the title “The ultimate technique of making
          tea” with a Royal ring and a letter. The Queen of England together
          with all the tea in England are kidnapped. The letter is from the evil
          teaglar who challenges you to come and catch him... if you can.
        </p>
        <h4>Digital unwrapping</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            User's friends come to the Hague with private jet to take him to the
            mission for rescuing the Queen and tea. Each of them has specific
            power like +5 strength, +5 speed etc. As they arrive at the place
            where the Queen is held, they see the path of tea leaves.
          </li>
          <li>
            They meet the first person to fight who is a ninja, so he is very
            fast. The user fights with his fast friend. They beat him and gets a
            diamond. User's power - to steal powers/skills. For fighting a
            ninja, he gets a skill of being super-fast. With each challenge one
            friend stays behind and the user faces the villain alone. There is
            also character development, increase of level as the lowest to the
            highest after killing the enemy.
          </li>
          <li>
            They enter the enemy base. They find a locked up old man who
            identifies himself as the queen’s advisor. The old man says that
            they are keeping the sword Excalibur with him in the cell and that
            they need it to defeat the villain and safe the queen. They solve a
            puzzle and rescue the man.
          </li>
          <li>
            They enter the boss layer and face the maze separating them from the
            queen and villain. The queen shouts to follow the trail she secretly
            left, and the user has to reach the villain alone. The user defeats
            the villain and uses the sword to break out the queen. As a reward
            the Queen gives them a treasure box. When user opens it, there is
            his gift for his birthday.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          The prototyping started with low-fi digital and physical prototypes.
          First, I tried our things on the paper and created paper prototype.
        </p>
        <img class="smaller_pic" src="images/paper prototype.jpg" />
        <p>
          Along with that I created a physical prototype for the token that a
          user received. A token worked as an invitation for a user to the
          digital unwrapping.<br />After that it was time to start digital
          prototype. Totally I went through three circles of testing and
          iterations. Here are some first screens and last versions.
        </p>
        <h4>Final battle</h4>
        <img src="images/battle.png" />
        <h4>The maze</h4>
        <img src="images/maze.png" />
        <h4>The ninja scene</h4>
        <img src="images/ninja.png" />
        <h3>Final design team prototype</h3>
        <p>
          At the my partner and I had to combine our individual prototypes and
          come up with final design team digital prototype. Be took my partner
          aesthetics for the base since we decided this style will fit a gamer
          persona more. Nevertheless, we changed the narrative, some design
          decisions and elements based on my prototype. This allowed us to
          combine the best parts of our individual prototypes and create
          engaging and immersive gifting experience for our persona.
        </p>

        <img src="images/advisor.jpg" />
        <h2>Test</h2>
        <p>
          During the project I conducted user testing four times including tests
          of individual and design team protototypes. The testing was made both
          with gamers and non-gamers. Gamers were there to test immersion and
          activation, while non-gamers were needed to test ease-of-use. The idea
          behind it was that if even non-gamers will not have usability problems
          then gamers will understand the interface for sure.<br />
          After each user testing there was a circle of iterations according to
          feedback, both of the narrative or UI of the prototype. The users were
          included in testing since early stages of prototyping what allowed to
          identify issues from the beginning and react proactively. Since for
          the prototyping we had less than two weeks, it was important to test
          from the beginning not to waste time for something that would not
          work.<br />
          That's why I switched to hi-fi prototypes only after several circled
          or testing of lo-fi prototypes.
        </p>
        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>
          The project took two months and during this time I went through all
          the stages of design thinking process together with my partner. At the
          end we had engaging and very personalised gifting experience for our
          persona. The prototype includes user's friends and they go on
          adventure together that covers UX factors immersion and relatedness.
          At the same time, a user was activated through the rewarding system
          included in a game and felt competent because of overcoming
          challenges. The project introduced to me the whole circle of design
          process and allowed me to experience work in a design team.
