        <h1>Prototyping</h1>
        <p>
          This app was the very first project we worked on in the university and
          also my first work in Adobe XD. For me it was the chance to learn the
          basics of the program and prototyping. During prototyping I had
          several iterations based on the feedback I got from my friends. I
          tried different layout and color paletters of the app. The app
          includes landing page, page with hobbies, my inspiration and some
          stories about me.
        </p>
        <h3>Iteration of landing page</h3>
        <img class="smaller_pic" src="images/app land page.png" alt="app lading page screens"/>
        <h3>Iteration of food page</h3>
        <img src="images/food page app.png" alt="app food page screens"/>
        <p>
          While building the app I learned how to work with Adobe XD tools. The
          project included a self-study since during the lectures we were taught
          the very basics. To create more interesting interactions and design I
          had to study a lot of materials myself. During the project I was
          curious and hard-working and tried to go above the expectations. Even
          though it was the very first project, I wanted to create something
          close to the real-life app and include some interesting features like
          popping out elements.
        </p>
        <h1>Visual communication</h1>
        <p>
          At the beginning of this project I was very confused how to work with
          colours, accents and typography. I tried out different colour palettes
          but my first attempts were not that successful because the colors and
          fonts didn't really work well together.<br />
          After that I examined several resources about UI to get the basics and
          changed the visual aspect of my app for better. I still sticked to the
          initial colour theme since it was my initial idea to have pale pastel
          colour as the main, but I improves the accent colour and colour
          paletter in general.
        </p>
        <h3>Iteration of visuals</h3>
        <p>
          For the first versions of the app I used the colour paletter that
          didn't quite work well because of absence of accent colour and
          contrast. In the final version I paid close attention to this to make
          the visual aspect of the app more pleasant and understandable.
        </p>
        <div class="ui_example">
          <div class="left_block">
            <h4>Initial UI</h4>
            <img src="images/ui initial.png" alt="initial colours and typography"/>
          </div>
          <div class="final_ui">
            <h4>Final UI</h4>

            The final version of visual content of the app allowed to create
            intuitive design and in general better looking app. Final version
            already included main colour and couple of accent colours.

        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>
          In the beginning of the project I felt lost because I didn't know much
          about prototyping, UI and Adobe XD tools. Within three weeks I managed
          to study a lot of materials and create my first app for presenting
          myself to classmates and lecturers. During this short period of time I
          got my hands on basic tools of Adobe XD, UI theories and rules, basic
          knowledge about prototyping. This project was my start in learning
          prototyping and allowed me to learn from my mistakes.
